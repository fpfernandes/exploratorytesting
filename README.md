# Exploratory Testing on E-commerce Website

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on Exploratory Testing performed on the https://timex.com/ website to uncover potential issues in the functionality, user experience, and performance of the system. The goal of this testing session was to simulate real user behavior, identify bugs, and evaluate the overall user journey from product selection to checkout.

### Test Strategy:
* The testing covered the following areas of the e-commerce website:
 - Homepage and Navigation: Verifying page load times, responsiveness, and the correct rendering of elements across devices.
 - Product Search and Filters: Ensuring search functionality works as expected and filters correctly refine search results.
 - Product Pages: Checking for correct pricing, availability, and accurate descriptions.
 - Shopping Cart: Adding/removing products and verifying cart totals.

### Defects Found:
